      <h2 id="subtitle">Invertebrate Collections Assistant | April 2024 - Present</h2>
      <p>University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa, Al)<br /><br /></p>

      <p>
        Digitize and organize a previously unsorted collection of thousands of
        invertebrate specimens. Utilizing the ARCTOS Collaborative Collection
        Management System, I ensure the collection is scientifically verified
        and publicly accessible for academic research. My responsibilities
        include digitizing specimens, verifying collection data through
        extensive research with primary and secondary sources, and maintaining
        accuracy in the rapidly evolving gastropod phylogeny. This ongoing
        effort brings the collection to modern standards and enhances its
        accessibility and research value.

        Allocate membership-driven funding to achieve 501(c)(7) income
        tax-exempt status for the makerspace, enabling it to procure additional

        weekly tours to increase visibility and foster member engagement,
        procuring and transporting equipment to enhance the electronics section,
        woodshop, and metal shop, and providing detailed documentation to ensure
        effective communication and alignment among project stakeholders. This
        effort supports the makerspace's growth and long-term sustainability.
